# CS099 Rock Paper Scissors

For this assignment you are to use your knowledge of functions to help you implement the game Rock Paper Scissors.

The game will be a two player game. Player One will use the keys: `A`, `S`, and `D` for Rock, Paper, Scissors respectively. Player Two will use `H`, `J`, and `K`.

Until both players have selected something the results should be hidden.

After the reveal, the game should be playable again by pressing any keyboard button.

Create a **`SubmissionNotes.md`** file that defines the following

1. your name, assignment name/number, course name, term
2. Section describing anything incomplete about the assignment
3. File and line number for 1 used function that takes in a JSON object and modifies it. _(Modifies it by reference and has no return value.)_
4. File and line numbers for 2 used functions that takes in input and does a task, like `DrawFace(x,y)` _(Takes in any kind of parameters to do something and has no return value.)_
5. File and line numbers for 2 used functions that takes in input and returns a calculated value. _(Takes in any kind of parameters to calculate something and then returns the calculation.)_

## Submission

You will be submitting a zip file of your work. In the p5.js editor you can create this zip easily by clicking on File --> Download

You will need to add your `SubmissionNotes.md` and this `ReadMe.md` file.

The name of the ZIP file must follow this naming convention: `[class_name]_[login]_rps_game.zip`

For example, if a student had the login name fun.frank then the appropriate filename would be `cs099_fun.frank_rps_game.zip`. Note: The .zip file names are case-sensitive and must be in all lowercase, exactly as described above.
